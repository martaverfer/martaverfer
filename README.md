# Hi there, I'm **Marta**! 👋👩‍💻🔬

Welcome to My GitHub Profile! I'm a **Data Science & Machine Learning** enthusiast who recently completed the Ironhack Bootcamp and is now building personal projects that apply advanced ML, NLP, and generative AI techniques. With a solid background in **Biosciences**, I bring a unique perspective to data-driven solutions, particularly in areas like healthcare, life sciences, and bioinformatics.

In addition, I have experience working as a **Backend Software Developer**, where I gained strong technical skills in building scalable applications and managing databases.

The coolest part about my approach is that I’m not just thinking about data in isolation. By combining my biosciences knowledge with software development expertise, I can take a well-rounded approach to data science problems, making a real-world impact—whether it’s improving healthcare, advancing research, or creating smarter systems.
